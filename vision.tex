\section{Vision}

Embedded devices are no longer the realm of large development teams of hardware
and firmware experts. Hardware platform development is cheap and easy enough for
small startups and even amatuers to engage in. Future embedded products will
surely take advantage of these trends. 

As toolkits and standards like Arduino have attracted a new crowd of independent
programmers, hobbyists and artists to embedded software development. Instead of
closed platforms developed entirely ahead of time, embedded software will be
updated by the manufacturer. End-users will be allowed to install third-party
applications. Moreover, technologies like circuit printing and 3D-printing have
become cheap and accessible. As a result, end-products and hardware platforms
will be built not only at large scale, but increasingly by hobbyists for
personal use and by small development teams in small batch.
