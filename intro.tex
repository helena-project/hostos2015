\section{Introduction}

Traditionally, microcontrollers ran monolithic applications that were written
once to run for months or years untouched~\endnote{In a forest somewhere in
the Amazon, collecting data about honey bee mating behavior.}. As a result,
unlike desktop and server operating systems, embedded operating systems like
TinyOS assume that applications are trustworthy and give them unfettered
access to the underlying hardware. However, we believe the world has changed.
Modern microcontrollers power consumer products like fitness bands and smart
watches~\endnote{the Pebble smartwatch and Fitbit both run on a STM
Cortex-M3, while the Jawbone UP runs on an MSP420}. These products often
include multiple independent applications sharing the hardware which may be
installed and/or updated by the end-user. We must rethink how we design
embedded operating systems to accomodate these new trends, understanding that
traditional desktop operating systems are too power hungry and rely on
hardware mechanisms (such as an MMU) not available in embedded
microporcessors.

Tock is a next-generation embedded operating system for the ARM Cortex-M
series of microprocessors. Tock provides isolation and protection between
applications and the kernel using three mechanisms at different levels:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Language level protection} Tock is written in Rust, a type-safe,
  compiled, low-level language. Tock's enforces isolation between it's
  internal components (e.g. core device drivers) using language-level
  protection~\endnote{Yeah, I know, this is really vague right now}.
  
  \item \emph{Software-managed memory protection} Modern ARM Cortex-M
  processors provide a hardware protection mechanism called Memory Protection
  Unit (MPU).  An MPU allows the kernel to set access permissions on a fixed
  number of memory regions which are enforced on application code. Unlike the
  Memory Manage Units (MMUs) in application processors, MPUs do not provide
  virtual addressing, however, like MMUs illegal accesses to memory regions
  (e.g. writing to read-only memory) are caught and result in a fault to the
  kernel. Tock uses the MPU to protect kernel and driver memory from untrusted
  application code and different applications from one another, while
  providing applications direct access to hardware registers, such as the
  GPIO.

  \item \emph{Physically isolated cores} Modern embedded platforms often
  involve multiple microprocessors in practice. For example, both the CC2540
  and the NRF51822 Bluetooth modules are, in fact, full blown microprocessors,
  but many products include them in addition to another
  microprocessor~\endnote{Well, at least Coin does that}. Tock leverage
  multiprocessor environments to enforce another layer of isolation between
  applications and the kernel, by running different application components on
  different cores depending on their needs to access specific hardware, as
  well as power and performance constraints.
