\subsection{Multiple Processors}

Modern embedded platforms increasingly include multiple microprocessors. Often,
peripheral devices like radio modules are actually a full blown microprocessor
that to allow the application controller to offload low-level radio
functionality and reduce overall power~\cite{nrf51822,cc2540}. In other cases, a
similar microprocessor with a different energy profile to provide applications
with more control over the energy-performance tradeoff.  For example, the Nest
Protect includes a main Cortex-M4 application controller, a secondary Cortex-M0+
peripheral processor and the EM357 802.15.4 radio SoC, which has an additional
onboard Cortex-M3~\cite{nestprotect-teardown}.

\name leverages multiprocessor environments to provide protection where
language-level and memory isolation are insufficient. In a multi-application
environment, time-sensitive applications (e.g. that must process requests
within a single radio scheduling quantum) are protected from interference by,
e.g compute heavy applications. In addition, \name schedules applications on
different processors to applications handling sensitive data from side-channel
attacks by other applications.
