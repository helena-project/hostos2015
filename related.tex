Embedded systems have historically had highly fragmented application domains,
each with a vertically integrated set of software and technology that
applications can highly customize as needed. However, until now, a common
assumption in almost all embedded systems is that a single group of developers
is responsible for all of the code running on a device. They might borrow
or use libraries or operating systems from elsewhere, but that code is 
completely under their control to modify and inspect as needed. Making
this assumption means that embedded operating systems typically have
minimal or no system security to protect themselves from malicious code
or applications.

One extreme example of this approach is TinyOS, which makes no
distinction between application and operating system code. Application
code specifies which abstractions and services it needs from the
operating system, and the compilation toolchain uses this information
to build an application-specific version of the OS that is compiled
and directly linked with application code~\cite{tinyos}. Later
versions of TinyOS included a threading library with which one could
dynamically load and link applications~\cite{tosthreads}. These
threads, however, operate under the assumption that the application
developer and the system maintainer are the same person: there are no
security checks and since there is no memory protection applications
have unlimited access to the entire system.

The Contiki operating system is another microcontroller-based
operating system. It has led TCP/IP integration with embedded systems
through libraries such as the $\mu$IP stack and a fully
certified IPv6 stack contributed by Cisco in 2008~\cite{contiki}. 
Security in Contiki is limited to
link-layer encryption and integrity and the OS does not support
dynamically loaded applications.

FreeRTOS is an open-source commercial operating system intended to 
support a wide range of applications on many different processors. It
is used in applications from the Nest Protect to smart meters to
thermal monitoring systems. FreeRTOS supports for network security
through TLS~\cite{tls} and DTLS~\cite{dtls}, but operates under the
assumption that all code is trusted. For example, any task in the system
can spawn a task that runs in privileged mode and arbitrarily modify
