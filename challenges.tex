\section{Challenges}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The compiler and OS should synthesize a multi-core execution plan
  subject to developer configuration/annotation in the code and, potentially,
  real time constraints.

  \item What is the execution model?

  \item The kernel must provide a way of inspecting the state of the system
  during debugging. For example, in TinyOS, timer callbacks are determined
  statically, but this would not be the case in a syscall based system with
  dynamic applications. The kernel should therefore provide a way to query,
  e.g., which timer's are currently outstanding.

\end{enumerate}
