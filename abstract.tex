Microcontroller operating systems and frameworks typically assume that a single,
monolothic application will run on an embedded system. In fact, hitorically,
power consumption, memory and code sizes, and lack of hardware support have
constrained microcontroller applications to be single-function. This is no
longer the case with modern hardware. Modern micocontrollers, like the Atmel
SAM4L (an ARM Cortex-M4), provides over six times more SRAM and over five times
larger flash than the TI~MSP430 that powered the TelosB motes while maintaining
similar power draws (90~{\uA}/MHz active and 3~\uA at sleep). At the same
time, embedded products are increasingly becoming development platforms and
application ecosystems for products like the Pebble watch are emerging. The
operating systems community should leverage new hardware, advancements in
programming languages as well as our experience from the Web, and other
application rich ecosystems, to build the next generation of embedded operating
systems.
