\section{Evolved Embedded Applications}
Traditionally embedded device developers were writing applications part of
runtime environment on the device. With the emerge of operating systems like
TinyOS the application and OS spaces were separated, making it easier to
write applications for embedded devices. 

Current paradigm in embedded devices is that not only multiple and independently
developed application has to co-exist but also embedded devices are modular and
can be extended with peripherals featuring their own microcontrollers with
proprietary runtime. While Pebble watch is an example of embedded device
supporting applications, devices like SimBand

aim to create a core hardware platform allowing to add and remove sensing
peripherals after the deployment.
