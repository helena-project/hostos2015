Embedded systems have historically had highly fragmented application domains,
each with a vertically integrated set of software and hardware
% that
% applications can customize as needed. However, until now, a common
% assumption in almost all embedded systems is
that a single group of developers
is responsible for.
%all of the code running on a device.
This complete oversight has typically meant
% They might borrow
% or use libraries or operating systems from elsewhere, but that code is
% completely under their control to modify and inspect as needed. Making
% this assumption means
that embedded operating systems have
minimal or no system security to protect themselves from malicious code
or applications.

One extreme example of this approach is TinyOS~\cite{tinyos}, which makes no
distinction between application and operating system code. Application
code specifies which abstractions and services it needs from the
operating system, and the compilation toolchain uses this information
to build an application-specific version of the OS that is compiled
and directly linked with application code.
Even with the threading library, TOSTheads~\cite{tosthreads}, and
dynamically linked applications, the
% Later
% versions of TinyOS included a threading library with which one could
% dynamically load and link applications~\cite{tosthreads}. These
% threads, however, operate under the assumption that the
application
developer and the system maintainer are assumed to be the same person
and applications
% : there are no
% security checks and since there is no memory protection applications
have unlimited access to the entire system.

The Contiki~\cite{contiki} operating system is another microcontroller-based
operating system
with extensive networking support.
% . It has led TCP/IP integration with embedded systems
% through libraries such as the $\mu$IP stack and a fully
% certified IPv6 stack contributed by Cisco in 2008~\cite{contiki}.
Security in Contiki is limited to
link-layer encryption and integrity and the OS does not support
dynamically loaded applications.
%% again this is not true contiki supports dynically loaded code.

FreeRTOS~\cite{freertos} is an open-source commercial operating system intended to
support a wide range of applications on many different processors. It
is used in applications from the Nest Protect to smart meters to
thermal monitoring systems. FreeRTOS supports for network security
through TLS~\cite{tls} and DTLS~\cite{dtls}, but operates under the
assumption that all code is trusted. For example, any task in the system
can spawn a task that runs in privileged mode and arbitrarily modify

the system~\cite{rtos-tasks,rtos-sec}.

Other embedded operating systems have explored designs with a core kernel and
separate applications. For example, SOS~\cite{han05sos} provides dynamically
loadable applications and drivers on top of a core kernel. However, given
the hardware constraints when SOS was developed, it provided no memory protection
and assumed trust between applications.
