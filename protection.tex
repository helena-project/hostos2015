\section{Protection \emph{is} a New Primitive}

% pp 33--34, ch 1, sec 4:
In Tanenbaum's \emph{Modern Operating Systems} he asserts, ``The main property
which distinguishes embedded systems from handhelds is the certainty that no
untrusted software will ever run on it''~\cite{tanenbaum}. In this paper we
argue that this is no longer the case. As a class of device, embedded systems
are evolving beyond the single-application case, and as a consequence, they
require their operating system to provide process isolation, enforced resource
arbitration, and protection.
%
Three trends, modern language design, new microcontroller hardware primitives,
and contemporary multi-MCU system design afford new opportunites to provide
protection as a primitive that was previously unavailable to embedded systems.
We are exploring these protection mechanisms in a new embedded operating system
called \name. We are designing \name specifically for embedded products that
will allow end-users to install third-party applications during deployment and
that incorporate arbitrary new devices in many configurations.
